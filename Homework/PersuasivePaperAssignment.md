Persuasive Paper Assignment
===========================
Write a short paper persuading me about the correctness of one side of a given technical issue. You may gather information about the topic yourself, or interview a professional software developer.

Due: At the start of class on February 24

Guidelines
-----------
1. The paper should be short. It must be long enough to make the case effectively, but as brief as possible. It should not be more than 2-3 pages long.
2. You may choose any issue related to developing concurrent software. Part of the paper may involve persuading me that this issue matters.
3. You may turn the paper in prior to the due date, and I'll provide my feedback. You can then modify the paper and submit it again.

Possible Topics
----------------
These are possible topics. Please feel free to choose one of them or to find a different one that interests you.

* Average programmers should (or should not) write concurrent code.
* Double-checked locking is broken in C++.
* The best tool for concurrency is: (thread, process, task, etc.).
* The future of concurrency does (or does not) lie in heterogeneous hardware architectures. We should (or should not) re-write our code to support them.
* Functional languages are the best tool for developing concurrent software.
* The actor pattern is the best pattern for developing concurrent software.
