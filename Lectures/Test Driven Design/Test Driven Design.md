Test Driven Design Lecture Notes
================================
Slide 1
-------
* TDD is a software development practice.
* Some companies or communities have a very strong TDD culture.
* A other companies it is barely used.
* Some claim professional developers must us TDD - this is a ongoing discussion.
* Very few developers are trained in its practice.
* I did not learn it immediately, but now I use it for nearly all development.

Slide 4
-------
* I'll first discuss how to do TDD, which may not make too much sense.
* Then we'll see an example of the principles in practice.
* This may seem a bit odd, but stick with me.

Slide 6
-------
* The mantra of TDD is to do the simplest change necessary to get a test to pass.
* The TPP explains what that simplest thing is.
* Bob Martin discovered TPP with bubble sort vs. quick sort.

Slide 8
-------
* The LoD seems simple, but it is easy to violate.
* It violation has a significant impact on a large code base. It becomes very difficult to change.
